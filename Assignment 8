changes made in Hadoop 2.x 

* If we compared with hadoop 1.x ,In single point failure some changes has been done and decentralize JobTraker power to data nodes.
* YARN represents  for "Yet Another Source Negotiator".
* cluster utilization used in YARN effectively.
* In hadoop 2.x this one is the one of the most powerful technology.
* To ease the JobTraker problems the features Unlike 1.x,JobTraker,resource manager and job scheduling/monitoring done(Application Master)separate daemons.
* Map reduce slots can be  changed from static to dynamic
* node limitation, job tracker bottleneck has been rectified(4000 to unlimited).
* The another advantage is that it allows other application to integrate with HDFS.\

MapReduce 1 and MapReduce 2 / Yarn diffe

*In mapreduce 1,hadoop centralized all tasks to the JobTraker.It resourses are allocated and scheduled the jobs across the cluster.,
*To ease the work pressure on the JobTracker it is decentralised.
*Resource Manager responsibility allocate resources to the particular nodes and node manager schedule the jobs on the application master.
*YARN allows excecution parallely and it manages the application manager and job excecution.
*This approach can ease many JobTraker problems and scale up ability has been improved because of this method and job performance is get optimized.
*It can also allows for multiple applications creation to scale up on the distributed environment.
